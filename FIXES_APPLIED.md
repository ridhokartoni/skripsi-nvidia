# Fixes Applied to GPU Container Platform

## Date: August 7, 2025

### 1. Backend API Fixes (Payment and Ticket Services)

#### Payment Service (`/home/Coding/skripsi/skripsi-admin/src/api/payment/payment.services.js`)
- **Fixed**: Added `include` statements to fetch related user and package data
- **Changes**:
  - `getAllPayment()` now includes user and paket relations
  - `getAllPaymentByUserId()` now includes user and paket relations

#### Ticket Service (`/home/Coding/skripsi/skripsi-admin/src/api/tiket/tiket.services.js`)
- **Fixed**: Added `include` statements to fetch related container and user data
- **Changes**:
  - `getAllTiket()` now includes container and user relations
  - `getTiketByUserId()` now includes container data

### 2. Frontend Pages Created

#### Admin Payments Page (`/admin/payments`)
- Full payment management interface
- View all payments with user and package details
- Confirm or reject pending payments
- Filter by payment status
- Shows payment statistics

#### Admin Tickets Page (`/admin/tickets`)
- Complete ticket management system
- View all support tickets
- Update ticket status (open, in progress, resolved, closed)
- Filter by ticket status
- Shows ticket statistics with container info

#### Admin Settings Page (`/admin/settings`)
- System configuration interface
- Container defaults (CPU, RAM, GPU limits)
- Security settings (session timeout, login attempts)
- Notification settings (email, SMS)
- Maintenance mode toggle

### 3. Frontend API Updates (`/home/Coding/skripsi/skripsi-frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)
- Added `confirmPayment()` and `rejectPayment()` functions
- Fixed payment status codes (1 for confirmed, 2 for rejected)
- Added proper ticket API with correct naming

### 4. Database Updates
- Created test admin user (email: admin@test.com, password: Admin123!)
- Created test user (test subjek)
- Sample payments and containers exist in database

## How to Apply All Fixes

### Step 1: Update Docker Container (Backend is running in Docker)
```bash
# The backend is running in a Docker container named 'skripsi-admin-api'
# Changes have been copied to the container and it has been restarted

# To verify backend is running:
docker ps | grep skripsi-admin-api

# To restart if needed:
docker restart skripsi-admin-api
```

### Step 2: Refresh Frontend Pages
Simply refresh your browser on the affected pages:
- http://localhost:3001/admin/payments
- http://localhost:3001/admin/tickets
- http://localhost:3001/admin/settings
- http://localhost:3001/user/payments

### Step 3: Test the Fixes
1. **Admin Payments**: Should now show user names and package names correctly
2. **Admin Tickets**: Should show container and user information
3. **Payment Actions**: Confirm/Reject buttons should work without errors
4. **User Payments**: Should show package names in the payment list

## Known Issues Resolved
1. ✅ "Unknown User" and "Unknown Package" in payments - FIXED
2. ✅ "Failed to reject payment" error - FIXED
3. ✅ Missing admin pages (404 errors) - FIXED
4. ✅ Ticket management not showing user/container info - FIXED

## Container Access Information
- Containers run on exposed ports (SSH and Jupyter)
- Access via SSH: `ssh -p [SSH_PORT] root@localhost`
- Access via Jupyter: `http://localhost:[JUPYTER_PORT]`
- Passwords stored in database Container table
- See CONTAINER_ACCESS.md for detailed instructions

## Database Information
- PostgreSQL running in Docker container
- Database: nvidia
- User: qaisjabbar
- Password: 123
- Access: `docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U qaisjabbar -d nvidia`

## Application Status
- Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3001
- Backend API: Running on http://localhost:3000 (in Docker container)
- Database: Running in postgres-container
- All services are operational

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper error handling for missing relations
2. Add loading states for data fetching
3. Implement pagination for large datasets
4. Add audit logging for admin actions
5. Implement automated backups for database
6. Add monitoring for container resource usage
