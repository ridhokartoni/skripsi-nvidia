# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Problem Statement
Users were experiencing unexpected logouts when refreshing certain pages in the application. Some routes would maintain the session while others would redirect to the login page immediately upon refresh.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Zustand Store Hydration Issue**
- The authentication state was stored in Zustand with persistence to localStorage
- On page refresh, there's a delay between initial render and when Zustand hydrates from localStorage
- Pages checking for authentication in `useEffect` would see `user = null` before hydration completed
- This caused immediate redirects to login even though the user was actually authenticated

### 2. **Inconsistent Auth Checks**
- Some pages (admin/page.tsx, user/page.tsx) had auth checks in useEffect
- Other pages (admin/containers/page.tsx) had no auth checks at all
- No centralized authentication middleware

### 3. **Cookie vs LocalStorage**
- Authentication relied solely on localStorage, which isn't available during SSR
- No cookie-based authentication for server-side checks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Next.js Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`)
Created server-side middleware that:
- Checks for authentication token in cookies
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Preserves the original URL for redirect after login
- Handles public vs protected routes

### 2. **Enhanced Auth Store** (`src/store/authStore.ts`)
Updated to:
- Store tokens in both localStorage AND cookies
- Track hydration state (`isHydrated` flag)
- Remove cookies on logout
- Handle rehydration callback

### 3. **Custom Auth Hook** (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
Created `useAuth` and `useAuthProtected` hooks that:
- Wait for store hydration before checking auth
- Handle role-based access (admin vs user)
- Provide loading states during hydration
- Centralize authentication logic

### 4. **Updated Page Components**
Modified dashboard pages to use the new auth hook:
- Replaced direct `useAuthStore` usage with `useAuthProtected`
- Removed manual auth checks in useEffect
- Added proper loading states during auth verification

### 5. **Login Page Improvements**
- Handle redirect URLs from query parameters
- Set cookies on successful login
- Redirect to original page after authentication

## Technical Details

### Cookie Implementation
```javascript
// Set cookie with 7-day expiration
setCookie('token', token, 7);

// Cookie format
document.cookie = `token=${value};expires=${expires};path=/;SameSite=Lax`;
```

### Middleware Configuration
- Protects `/admin/*` and `/user/*` routes
- Allows public access to `/login`, `/register`, and `/`
- Preserves requested URL in `from` parameter

### Hydration Flow
1. Page loads → Middleware checks cookies
2. If authenticated → Allow access
3. Component mounts → Wait for Zustand hydration
4. After hydration → Verify user role and permissions
5. Ready state → Render protected content

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Authentication**: All routes now maintain session on refresh
2. **Better UX**: No flash of login page for authenticated users
3. **Server-Side Protection**: Routes protected at middleware level
4. **Centralized Logic**: Single source of truth for auth checks
5. **Role-Based Access**: Proper admin vs user route protection

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Login as admin/user
2. Navigate to any protected route
3. Refresh the browser (F5)
4. User should remain on the same page without redirect

## Files Modified

- `/src/middleware.ts` (new)
- `/src/store/authStore.ts` (updated)
- `/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` (new)
- `/src/app/admin/page.tsx` (updated)
- `/src/app/user/page.tsx` (updated)
- `/src/app/login/page.tsx` (updated)

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing refresh token rotation
2. Add session timeout warnings
3. Implement remember me functionality
4. Add SSR-compatible authentication
5. Consider using HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security
