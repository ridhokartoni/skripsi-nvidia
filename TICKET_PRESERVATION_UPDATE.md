# Ticket Preservation System Update

## Problem Solved
Previously, when a container was deleted, all associated support tickets were also deleted, resulting in loss of historical data and support records. This update ensures tickets are preserved for administrative review and historical tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (Already Configured)
The `Tiket` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` already had the proper structure:
- `containerId` is nullable (`Int?`)
- Relationship with Container uses `onDelete: SetNull`
- Additional fields to store container/user info: `containerName`, `userName`, `userEmail`, `userPhone`

### 2. Backend Service Update (`docker.services.js`)
Modified the `deleteContainer` function to:
- Fetch container and user information before deletion
- Update all related tickets to set `containerId` to null
- Preserve container and user information in dedicated fields
- Then delete the container

```javascript
// Before: Tickets were deleted
await db.Tiket.deleteMany({
  where: { containerId: id }
});

// After: Tickets are preserved with historical data
const container = await db.Container.findUnique({
  where: { id },
  include: { user: true }
});

if (container) {
  await db.Tiket.updateMany({
    where: { containerId: id },
    data: {
      containerId: null,
      containerName: container.name,
      userName: container.user.fullName,
      userEmail: container.user.email,
      userPhone: container.user.noHp
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. Ticket Service (`tiket.services.js`)
Already properly configured to:
- Store container/user info when creating tickets
- Handle tickets with null `containerId` (deleted containers)

### 4. Ticket Routes (`tiket.routes.js`)
Already handles permission checks for tickets with deleted containers:
- Only admins can update tickets with deleted containers
- Regular users can only update their own container tickets

## Benefits

1. **Historical Tracking**: All support tickets are preserved for audit and analysis
2. **User Information Retention**: Even after container deletion, admin can see who reported issues
3. **Support Continuity**: Support history remains intact for better customer service
4. **Compliance**: Maintains records for potential compliance requirements

## Data Flow

### When Creating a Ticket:
1. User creates ticket for their container
2. System stores `containerId` reference
3. System also stores container name and user info as backup

### When Deleting a Container:
1. Admin deletes container
2. System updates all related tickets:
   - Sets `containerId` to null
   - Preserves `containerName`, `userName`, `userEmail`, `userPhone`
3. Container is removed from database
4. Tickets remain with historical information

### Viewing Tickets After Container Deletion:
- Ticket shows `containerId: null`
- Admin can still see:
  - Original container name
  - User who created the ticket
  - User's contact information
  - Ticket description and status

## Testing

To verify the system works correctly:

1. Create a container
2. Create a ticket for that container
3. Delete the container
4. Check that the ticket still exists with preserved information

Use the provided test script:
```bash
node test-ticket-preservation.js
```

## Frontend Considerations

The frontend should handle tickets with null `containerId`:
- Display "Container Deleted" or similar indicator
- Show preserved container name and user info
- Disable container-specific actions (like viewing container details)

## Migration Notes

- Existing tickets will be preserved going forward
- No data migration needed as schema already supports nullable `containerId`
- The foreign key constraint already uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`

## Rollback

If needed to rollback (not recommended):
1. Revert `docker.services.js` changes
2. Note: This would resume deleting tickets with containers

## Maintenance

- Monitor ticket table growth over time
- Consider archiving very old tickets if needed
- Ensure frontend properly handles null container references
